## How to use `.env` in vite project

Note: Make sure you already have TMDB's api key, if not, register an account and request for one. 

https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html

- create a file named `.env`
- make sure that `*.env` is already in your `.gitignore` (you don't want to commit this file)
- add `VITE_TMDB_KEY="{your_api_key}"` to `.env`

Usage: 
```ts
const res = await axios.get(`https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/now_playing?api_key=${import.meta.env.VITE_TMDB_KEY}`)
```
